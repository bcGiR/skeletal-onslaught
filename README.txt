SKELETAL ONSLAUGHT

This is a text adventure, role playing game written in Ruby as a chance for me to play around with a new language,
mess around with game design, learn and practice using git, and experiment with windows as a development environment.

So far, it has been a great learning experience in many ways and even though I am not very happy with it as a game,
as a project it has been very fun, educational, and rewarding.

Enjoy.
